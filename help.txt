 Algorithm Visualizer
========================

DESCRIPTION
    Algorithm Visualizer is a learning tool that allows you to see how different algorithms work step-by-step.

USAGE
    1. Choose an algorithm category:
         S - Sorting Algorithms
         G - Graph Algorithms
         F - Financial Algorithms
         A - Machine Learning / AI Algorithms

    2. Enter the algorithm name and data size:
         Example: bubble s
         Data size options:
             s - small
             m - medium
             l - large

COMMANDS
    --help       Show this help menu


EXAMPLES
    bubble m     Visualize Bubble Sort with medium data set
    dijkstra s   Visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm with small data set

NOTES
    - Data size affects the number of elements and visualization speed.
    - Some algorithms may not support all data sizes.
