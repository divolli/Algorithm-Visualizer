# 📓 Development Log — Algorithm Visualizer in C++

Welcome to the ongoing development log of my project: a C++ SFML-based algorithm visualizer to learn, explore, and teach algorithms visually and intuitively.

## 🗓️ Week 1, 01–07.08.2025

### ✔️ What I Did
- [x] Identified project structure
- [x] Set up Git & SFML
- [x] Created main window loop
- [x] Built algorithm visualizer engine
- [x] Designed abstract algorithm class

### 📚 What I Learned
- High-level overview of project creation
- Basics of SFML
- Virtual functions and abstract classes

### ❗️Challenges & Struggles
- Coming from a C background, I'm not as comfortable with OOP as I’d like to be. I had to read a lot about the object-oriented paradigm. The most challenging part was understanding polymorphism, virtual functions, and abstract classes.
- GUI or CUI?

### 🔜 What’s Next
- [ ] Create the main function with a text-based interface
- [ ] Implement the core logic for interacting with the program
- [ ] Add the first algorithm (Bubble Sort)


### 🖋 Notes
  After trying to implement the visualizer with a GUI, I found it a bit tedious — building all the welcome, main, and visualization windows felt like too much. I have to admit that, for now, it’s either beyond my current skill level or, more likely, beyond my current dedication. I just don’t want to spend a week or two creating a full graphical user interface. And a poorly designed welcome screen isn’t something I’d be happy with either.
So, if I can’t do it well, I’d rather try something else — in this case, a CUI (Console User Interface). It’ll be much easier to build and interact with, and I can spend far less time on that part while focusing on the actual goal: implementing algorithm visualization. That’s the whole point of this project — to learn more about algorithms.
Later, I might add a proper GUI on top of the core CUI logic once the foundation is solid.

  Was this week unproductive? Maybe. But at least I built a bare-bones version of the project (actually two versions!) and learned **a lot** about C++ — especially classes, virtual functions, and abstract classes. I also worked quite a bit with SFML, although I fell into the “AI trap”: it provided me a lot of copy-pasteable code, so I didn’t learn as much as I could have.
I’ve decided to reduce AI usage to a bare minimum: no more copy-pasting code, not even if I ask. Hints only! Otherwise, I get lazy — and the AI sometimes hallucinates anyway.

  Anyway, to avoid going off track — let’s just say this was more of a *setup & figure-it-out* week. I got a general understanding and idea of what the project will look like, so I’m not stopping here. I’m writing this on Day 6, with one day left. I probably won’t get much more done.
