# 📓 Development Log — Algorithm Visualizer in C++

Welcome to the ongoing development log of my solo project: a C++ SFML-based algorithm visualizer to learn, explore, and teach algorithms in a visual and intuitive way.

## 💬 Notes to Myself

- 💡 Don’t overengineer early — focus on simplicity first
- 🧩 Keep visual feedback snappy — instant clarity matters
- 🛠️ Reuse visual components where possible (bars, nodes, lines)
