# 🧠 C++ Algorithm Visualizer using SFML

A modular, real-time visualizer for over 60 of the most important and widely-used algorithms across **Computer Science**, **Finance**, and **Machine Learning / AI**, built entirely in **C++** using **SFML**.

## 📘 About the Project

I'm a student who has always struggled to deeply understand how algorithms work. Instead of just memorizing pseudo-code or watching abstract lectures, I decided to **build this visualizer** — not only to **teach myself** algorithms by coding them from scratch, but also to **see them in motion**.

This project is:
