# 🧠 C++ Algorithm Visualizer using SFML

A modular, real-time visualizer for the most widely-used algorithms across **Computer Science**, **Finance**, and **Machine Learning / AI**, built in **C++** using **SFML**.

## 📘 About the Project

I'm a student who has always wanted to deeply understand how algorithms work. Instead of just memorizing pseudo-code or watching abstract lectures, I decided to **build this visualizer** — not only to **teach myself** algorithms by coding them from scratch, but also to **see them in motion**.

This project is:

- 🔍 A personal **learning sandbox**
- 💡 A tool for others who learn better visually

I hope this project can inspire other learners or act as a useful **interactive source** for anyone studying algorithms.

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

This is a **solo learning project**, built in C++ with love (and a lot of debugging). It’s designed to be modular and expandable, with three main tracks:

### 🔷 Core Computer Science
Sorting, graphs, dynamic programming, trees, recursion

### 🟢 Finance / Trading
In progress

### 🧠 Machine Learning & AI
In progress

## 📅 Development Log

I’ll be updating a weekly `dev_log.md` in the repo, where I write down:
- What I’ve implemented
- What I learned or struggled with
- What I’m planning for the next week

Feel free to follow along, leave ideas, or just read it if you're curious how the project evolves.

## 🚀 Features (WIP)

- Real-time animation of algorithm steps
- Step-by-step execution & speed control
- Sorting with color-coded visual feedback

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **C++17 / C++20**
- **SFML** — Simple and Fast Multimedia Library
- **CMake** — Cross-platform build system

---

## 👨‍💻 How to Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/divolli/algorithm_visualization.git
cd algorithm_visualization

# Build with CMake
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run
./algorithm_visualizer
```

## 🎥 Screenshots / GIFs

Coming soon as I complete modules!
